DESCRIPTION
    Pretty Curved Privacy (pcp1) is a commandline utility which can be used
    to encrypt files. pcp1 uses eliptc curve cryptography for encryption
    (CURVE25519 by Dan J. Bernstein). While CURVE25519 is no worldwide
    accepted standard it hasn't been compromised by the NSA - which might be
    better, depending on your point of view.

    Caution: since CURVE25519 is no accepted standard, pcp1 has to be
    considered as experimental software. In fact, I wrote it just to learn
    about the curve and see how it works.

    Beside some differences it works like GNUPG. So, if you already know how
    to use gpg, you'll feel almost home.

QUICKSTART
    Lets say, Alicia and Bobby want to exchange encrypted messages. Here's
    what the've got to do.

    First, both have create a secret key:

     Alicia                             Bobby
     pcp1 -k                            pcp1 -k

    After entering their name, email address and a passphrase to protect the
    key, it will be stored in their vault file (by default ~/.pcpvault).

    Now, both of them have to export the public key, which has to be
    imported by the other one. With pcp you can export the public part of
    your primary key, but the better solution is to export a derived public
    key especially for the recipient:

     Alicia                             Bobby
     pcp1 -p -r Bobby -O alicia.pub     pcp1 -p -r Alicia -O bobby.pub

    They've to exchange the public key somehow (which is not my problem at
    the moment, use ssh, encrypted mail, whatever). Once exchanged, they
    have to import it:

     Alicia                             Bobby
     pcp1 -K -I bobby.pub               pcp1 -K -I alicia.pub

    They will see a response as this when done:

     key 0x29A323A2C295D391 added to .pcpvault.

    Now, Alicia finally writes the secret message, encrypts it and sends it
    to Bobby, who in turn decrypts it:

     Alicia                             Bobby
     echo "Love you, honey" > letter
     pcp1 -e -r Bobby -I letter -O letter.asc
     cat letter.asc | mail bobby@foo.bar

                                        pcp1 -d -I letter.asc | less

    And that's it.

    Please note the big difference to GPG though: both Alicia AND Bobby have
    to enter the passphrase for their secret key! That's the way CURVE25519
    works: you encrypt a message using your secret key and the recipients
    public key and the recipient does the opposite, he uses his secret key
    and your public key to actually decrypt the message.

    Oh - and if you're wondering why I named them Alicia and Bobby: I was
    just sick of Alice and Bob. We're running NSA-free, so we're using other
    sample names as well.

INSTALLATION
    There are currently no packages available, so pcp has to be compiled
    from source. Follow these steps:

    First, you will need libsodium:

     git clone git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
     cd libsodium
     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure && make check
     sudo make install
     sudo ldconfig
     cd ..

    Next, pcp:

     git clone git://github.com/tlinden/pcp.git
     cd pcp
     ./configure
     sudo make install
     cd ..

    Optionally, you might run the unit tests:

     make test
