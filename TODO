detach keysig generation from pub key export, so that an existing
keysig can be verified later.

key++: normalize id and lc()

allow signing using an alternate secret key, like in pcpdecrypt()

malloc() new pointers in functions only if not NULL, e.g. pcp_gennonce()

check pub key count in pcp.c before calling verify signature, croak if count==0

Update pod key format spec.

vault checksum: add keysigs as well

Add newlines to headers in define.h, so strlen() later catches the whole length.

Check is_utf8 license.

Symmetric decrypt mode tries to open vault

pcp_find_primary_secret() makes a copy ???

c++ destructor double free mess

cpptest 0 uses same Context for encryptor and decryptor,
must be another one for the latter!
