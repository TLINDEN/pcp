AIX@ppc: pipetest fails. encode is correct, same # of pkts as
	 on bsd + 1 pad. decode misses last pkt. Must be somewhere
	 in pcpstream.c.

detach keysig generation from pub key export, so that an existing
keysig can be verified later.

key++: normalize id and lc()

allow signing using an alternate secret key, like in pcpdecrypt()

malloc() new pointers in functions only if not NULL, e.g. pcp_gennonce()

check pub key count in pcp.c before calling verify signature, croak if count==0

vault checksum: add keysigs as well

Add newlines to headers in define.h, so strlen() later catches the whole length.
