 Z85 Encoding functions.

The Z85 encoding format is described here: <a href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32">ZeroMQ Spec.32</a>.
It's part of <a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>. Z85 is based on ASCII85 with
a couple of modifications (portability, readability etc).

To fulfil the requirements of the ZeroMQ Z85 functions, PCP
does some additional preparations of raw input before actually doing the 
encoding, since the input for zmq_z85_encode() must be divisible by 4. Therefore
we pad the input with zeroes and remove them after decoding.
