=head1 INSTALLATION

There are currently no packages available, so B<pcp> has to be
compiled from source. Follow these steps:

First, you will need libsodium:

 git clone git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
 cd libsodium
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure && make check
 sudo make install
 sudo ldconfig
 cd ..

If you want to have JSON support, you'll need to install the
Jansson library (optional):

 git clone git://github.com/akheron/jansson.git
 cd jansson
 autoreconf -i
 ./configure && make
 sudo make install
 cd ..

In order to use the python binding, you need to install the
B<cffi> python package.

Next, build pcp:

 git clone git://github.com/tlinden/pcp.git
 cd pcp
 ./configure
 sudo make install
 cd ..

Optionally, you might run the unit tests:

 make test
