                           item. Specify -V to get info about a
                           vault, -i to get info about a key id
                           installed in the vault or -I in which
                           case it determines itself what kind of
                           file it is.
 -h --help                 Print this help message.
    --version              Print program version.
 -D --debug                Enable debug output.
 -v --verbose              Enable verbose output.

 Keymanagement Options:
 -k --keygen               Generate a CURVE25519 secret key. If
                           the generated key is the first one in
                           your vault, it will become the primary
                           secret key. If an output file (-O) has
                           been specified, don't store the generated
                           key to the vault but export it to the
                           file instead. You will be asked for
                           an owner, mail and a passphrase. If you
                           leave the passphrase empty, the key will
                           be stored unencrypted.
 -l --listkeys             List all keys currently stored in your
                           vault. Only the key id's and some info
                           about the keys will be printed, not the
                           actual keys.
 -L --listkeys-verbose     Display a more verbose key listing
 -l -v                     including signature fingerprint, key
                           fingerprint, checksum and the like.
 -R --remove-key           Remove a key from the vault. Requires
                           option -i <keyid>.
 -s --export-secret        Export a secret key. If your vault only
                           contains one secret key, this one will
                           be exported. If a key id have been
                           specified (-i), this one will be used.
                           If there are more than one secret keys
                           in the vault and no key id has been
                           given, export the primary secret key.
                           Use -O to export to a file.
 -p --export-public        Export a public key. If no key id have
    --export               been specified, the public part of your
                           primary secret key will be exported.
                           Use -O to export to a file.
 -K --import               Import a key. pcp determines automatically
    --import-key           the key type and encodingg. Use -I to import
                           from a file.
 -y --export-yaml          Export all keys stored in your vault
                           as YAML formatted text. Use -O to put
                           the export into a file.
 -F --format               Export the key in a particular format.
                           Currently supported: pcp, pbp, yaml,
                           perl and C.
 
 Encryption Options:
 -e --encrypt              Asym-Encrypt a message. Read from stdin or
                           specified via -I. Output will be written
                           to stdout or the file given with -O.
                           If a keyid (-i) has been
                           given, use that public key for encryption.
                           If one or more recipient (-r) has been given,
                           encrypt the message for all recipients
                           asymetrically, given there are matching
                           public keys installed in the vault for them.
                           If none of -i or -r has been given, encrypt
                           the message symetrically. This is the same
                           as -m (self-encryption mode).
                           Add -z to ascii armor the output using Z85.
 -m --encrypt-me           Sym-Encrypt a message. Specify -I and/or
                           -O for input/output file. You will be asked
                           for a passphrase. No key material will
                           be used. Same as -e without -r and -i.
 -d --decrypt              Decrypt a message. Read from stdin or
                           specified via -I. Output to stdout or
                           written to the file specified via -O.
                           The primary secret key will be used for
                           decryption, if there is no primary and
                           just one secret key in the vault, this
                           one will be used. Otherwise you'll have
                           to specify the keyid (-i) of the key.
                           You need to have the public key of the
                           sender installed in your vault.
                           If the input is self-encrypted (symetrically)
                           a passphrase will be requested.
 
 Signature Options:
 -g --sign                 Create a signature of file specified with
                           -I (or from stdin) using your primary
                           secret key. If -r has been given, a derived
                           secret key will be used for signing.
 -c --check-signature <file> Verify a signature in file <file> against
                           the file specified with -I (or stdin).
                           The public key required for this must
                           exist in your vault file.
 -f --sigfile <file>       Write a detached signature file, which doesn't
                           contain the original content. Output will be
                           z85 encoded always. To verify, you need to
                           specify the original file to be verified
                           against using -I as well (plus -f <sigfile>).
 
 Encoding Options:
 -z --z85-encode           Encode (armor) something to Z85 encoding.
 -a --armor                If used with encryption or singing operation
    --textmode             encode its output. Otherwise encode a plain
                           file. Use -I and -O respectively, otherwise it
                           uses stdin/stdout.
 -Z --z85-decode           Decode (dearmor) something from Z85 encoding.
                           Use -I and -O respectively, otherwise it
                           uses stdin/stdout
 


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Pretty Curved Privacy> (pcp1) is a commandline utility which can
be used to encrypt files. B<pcp1> uses eliptc curve cryptography
for encryption (CURVE25519 by Dan J. Bernstein). While CURVE25519
is no worldwide accepted standard it hasn't been compromised by
the NSA - which might be better, depending on your point of view.

B<Caution>: since CURVE25519 is no accepted standard, B<pcp1> has
to be considered as experimental software. In fact, I wrote it just
to learn about the curve and see how it works.

Beside some differences it works like B<GNUPG>. So, if you already
know how to use gpg, you'll feel almost home.

=head1 QUICKSTART

Lets say, Alicia and Bobby want to exchange encrypted messages.
Here's what the've got to do.

First, both have create a secret key:

 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -k                            pcp1 -k

After entering their name, email address and a passphrase to protect
the key, it will be stored in their B<vault file> (by default ~/.pcpvault).

Now, both of them have to export the public key, which has to be
imported by the other one. With B<pcp> you can export the public
part of your primary key, but the better solution is to export
a derived public key especially for the recipient:

 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -p -r Bobby -O alicia.pub     pcp1 -p -r Alicia -O bobby.pub

They've to exchange the public key somehow (which is not my
problem at the moment, use ssh, encrypted mail, whatever). Once exchanged,
they have to import it:

 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -K -I bobby.pub               pcp1 -K -I alicia.pub

They will see a response as this when done:

 key 0x29A323A2C295D391 added to .pcpvault.

Now, Alicia finally writes the secret message, encrypts it and
sends it to Bobby, who in turn decrypts it:

 Alicia                             Bobby
 echo "Love you, honey" > letter
 pcp1 -e -r Bobby -I letter -O letter.asc
 cat letter.asc | mail bobby@foo.bar

                                    pcp1 -d -I letter.asc | less

And that's it.

Please note the big difference to B<GPG> though: both Alicia
AND Bobby have to enter the passphrase for their secret key!
That's the way CURVE25519 works: you encrypt a message using
your secret key and the recipients public key and the recipient
does the opposite, he uses his secret key and your public key
to actually decrypt the message.

Oh - and if you're wondering why I named them Alicia and Bobby:
I was just sick of Alice and Bob. We're running NSA-free, so we're
using other sample names as well.


=head1 PCP1 KEYS

B<pcp1> keys are stored in a binary file, called B<the vault>.
It's by default located in B<~/.pcpvault> but you can of course
specify another location using the B<-V> option.

There are two kinds of keys: secret and public keys. In reality
a secret key always includes its public key. Both types of keys
can be exported to files and transfered to other people who can
then import them. You should usually only do this with public keys
though.

There is a primary secret key which will always used for operations
when no keyid has been specified. However, you may have as many
secret keys in your vault as you like.

Each key can be identified using its B<keyid> which looks like this:

 0xD49119E85266509F

A public key exported from a secret key will have the same keyid
as the secret key.

If you just want to know details about a key or the vault, use the
B<-t> option.

=head1 ENCRYPTION

There are 2 modes of encryption available in pcp1:

=over

=item B<Standard public key encryption>

In this mode, which is the default, a public key as specified
with B<-i> or B<-r> and your primary secret key will be used
for encryption.

Example command:

 pcp1 -e -i 0x2BD734B15CE2722D -I message.txt -O message.asc

Here we didn't specify a recipient. Therefore the public
key given with -i will be used directly.

Another example:

 pcp1 -e -r Bobby -r McCoy -I message.txt -O message.asc

=item B<Self encryption mode>

You can also encrypt a file symetrically. No public key material
will be used in this mode.
While this works, the security of it totally depends on the
strength of the passphrase used for encryption.

Example command:

 pcp1 -e -I message.txt -O cipher.z85

As you can see we didn't specify -i or -r and therefore pcp1
operates in self mode for encryption. It will ask you for a passphrase
to protect the encryption key.

=back

=head1 SIGNATURES

There are 3 modes for digital signatures available on pcp1:

=over

=item B<Standard NACL binary signatures>

In this mode, which is the default, an ED25519 signature will
be calculated from a BLAKE2 hash of the input file content. Both
the original file content plus the signature will be written to
the output file.

Example:

 pcp1 -g -I message.txt -O message.asc -g

You will be asked for the passphrase to access your primary
secret key. The output file will be a binary file.

=item B<Armored NACL signatures>

While this mode does the very same calculations, the output
slightly differs. The output file will be marked as a signature
file, the signature itself will be appended with its own headers
and Z85 encoded.


Example:

 pcp1 -g -I message.txt -O message.asc -g -z

You will be asked for the passphrase to access your primary
secret key. The output file will be a text file.

=item B<Detached NACL signatures>

In some cases you will need to have the signature separated
from the original input file, e.g. to sign download files. You
can generate detached signatures for such purposes. Still, the
signature will be calculated the same way as in standard signatures
but put out into a separate file. A detached signature file will always
be Z85 encoded.

Example:

 pcp1 -g -I message.txt -O -g --sigfile message.sig

Verification by recipient:

 pcp -c -f message.sig -I message.txt

=back

=head1 SIGNED ENCRYPTION

Beside pure encryption and signatures pcp1 also supports signed
encryption. In this mode an input file will be encrypted and a
signature of the encrypted content and encrypted recipients with your primary
secret key will be appended.

The signature is encrypted as well.

Example:

 pcp1 -e -g -r Bobby -I README.txt -O README.asc

Please note the additional B<-g> parameter. The recipient can
decrypt and verify the so created data like this:

 pcp1 -d -I README.asc -o README.txt

If decryption works, the output file will be written. If signature
verification fails you will be informed, but the decrypted
output will be left untouched. It is up to you how to react
on an invalid signature.

=head1 ALTERNATIVE COMMANDLINES

You can save typing if you supply additional arguments to
pcp after commandline options. Such arguments are treated
as filenames or recipients, depending what options you already
specified.

Here is a list of commandlines and their possible alternatives:

 ORIGINAL                    ALTERNATIVE               DESCRIPTION

 pcp -e -I message -r Bob    pcp -e -r Bob message     use 'message' as inputfile.
                             pcp -e -I message Bob     use 'Bob' as recipient,
                                                       multiple recipients supported.

 pcp -d -I crypted           pcp -d crypted            use 'crypted' as inputfile.

 pcp -g -I message           pcp -g message            use 'message' as inputfile.

 pcp -g -I msg -O sig        pcp -g -I msg sig         use 'sig' as outputfile.

 pcp -p -O key.pcp           pcp -p key.pcp            use 'key.pcp' as outputfile.

 pcp -p -O key.pcp -r Bob    pcp -p -O key.pcp Bob     use 'Bob' as recipient.

 pcp -s -O key.pcp           pcp -s key.pcp            use 'key.pcp' as outputfile.

 pcp -s -O key.pcp -r Bob    pcp -s -O key.pcp Bob     use 'Bob' as recipient.

 pcp -K -I alice.pcp         pcp -K alice.pcp          use 'alice.pcp' as keyfile.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

pcp respects the following environment variables:

=over

=item B<PCP_VAULT>

Use an alternative vaultfile. The default is B<~/.pcpvault> and
can be overridden with the B<-V> commandline option. If PCP_VAULT
is set, this one will be used instead.

=item B<PCP_DEBUG>

Enable debugging output, where supported. Same as B<-D>.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Pcp may return one of several error codes if it encounters problems.

=over

=item 0   No problems occurred.

=item 1   Generic error code.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over

=item B<~/.pcpvault>

Default vault file where all keys are stored.

=back

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL STATUS

Currently there are a couple of problems which are currently
unsolved or in the process to be solved.

=over

=item B<No secure native key exchange for store-and-forward systems>

Pretty Curved Privacy is a store-and-forward system, it works
on files and can't use any cool key exchange protocols therefore.
For example there would be B<CurveCP> which guarantees a
secure key exchange. But CurveCP cannot be used offline.

Users have to find other means to exchange keys. That's a pity
since with Curve25519 you can't just publish your public key
to some key server because in order to encrypt a message, both
the recipient AND the sender need to have the public key of
each other. It would be possible to publish public keys,
and attach the senders public key to the encrypted message, but
I'm not sure if such an aproach would be secure enough.

=item B<Curve25519 not widely adopted>

At the time of this writing the ECC algorithm Curve25519
is only rarely used, in most cases by experimental software
(such as Pretty Curved Privacy). As far as I know there haven't
been done the kind of exessive crypto analysis as with other
ECC algorithms.

While I, as the author of pcp1 totally trust D.J.Bernstein, this
may not be the case for you.

In short, I'd suggest not to use it on critical systems yet.

=back

=head1 INTERNALS

=head2 VAULT FORMAT

The vault file contains all public and secret keys. It's a portable
binary file.

The file starts with a header:

 +-------------------------------------------+
 | Field        Size   Description           |
 +-------------------------------------------+
 | File ID    |    1 | Vault Identifier 0xC4 |
 +-------------------------------------------+
 | Version    |    4 | Big endian, version   |
 +-------------------------------------------+
 | Checksum   |   32 | SHA256 Checksum       |
 +-------------------------------------------+

The checksum is a checksum of all keys.

The header is followed by the keys. Each key is preceded by a
key header which looks like this:

 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Field        Size   Description            |
 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Type       |    1 | Key type (S,P,M)       |
 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Size       |    4 | Big endian, keysize    |
 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Version    |    4 | Big endian, keyversion |
 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Checksum   |   32 | SHA256 Key Checksum    |
 +--------------------------------------------+

Type can be one of:

 PCP_KEY_TYPE_MAINSECRET 0x01
 PCP_KEY_TYPE_SECRET     0x02
 PCP_KEY_TYPE_PUBLIC     0x03

The key header is followed by the actual key, see below.

=head2 SECRET KEY FORMAT

A secret key is a binary structure with the following format:


 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Public      |     32 | Curve25519 Public Key Part       |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Secret      |     32 | Curve25519 Secret Key Unencrypted|
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | ED25519 Pub |     32 | ED25519 Public Key Part          |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | ED25519 Sec |     64 | ED25519 Secret Key Unencrypted   |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Nonce       |     24 | Nonce for secret key encryption  |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Encrypted   |     48 | Encrypted Curve25519 Secret Key  |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Owner       |    255 | String, Name of Owner            |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Mail        |    255 | String, Email Address            |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | ID          |     17 | String, Key ID                   |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Ctime       |      4 | Creation time, sec since epoch   |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Version     |      4 | Key version                      |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Serial      |      4 | Serial Number                    |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Type        |      1 | Key Type                         |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+

Some notes:

The secret key fields will be filled with random data if the
key is encrypted. The first byte of it will be set to 0 in that
case.

The key id is a computed JEN Hash of the secret and public
key concatenated, put into hex, as a string.

The key version is a static value, currently 0x2. If the key
format changes in the future, this version number will be
increased to distinguish old from new keys.

Exported keys will be encoded in Z85 encoding. When such an
exported key is imported, only the actual Z85 encoded data
will be used. Header lines and lines starting with whitespace
will be ignored. They are only there for convenience.

Key generation works like this:

=over

=item *

Generate a random seed (32 bytes).

=item *

Generate a ED25519 sigining keypair from that seed.

=item *

Generate a random seed (32 bytes).

=item *

Generate a Curve25519 encryption keypair from that seed.

=back

So, while both secrets are stored in the sam PCP key, they
are otherwise unrelated. If one of them leaks, the other
cannot be recalculated from it.

Take a look at the function B<pcp_keypairs()> for details.

=head2 ENCRYPTED OUTPUT FORMAT

Encrypted output will always written as binary files. No armoring
supported yet. The encryption process works as this:

=over

=item generate a random symetric 32 byte key B<S>

=item encrypt it asymetrically for each recipient using a unique nonce (B<R>)

=item encrypt the input file 32k blockwise using the symetric key

=back

Symetric encryption works the very same with the recipient stuff
left out.

Formal format description, asymetric encrypted files:

 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Type        |      1 | Filetype, 5=ASYM, 23=SYM         |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Len R       |      4 | Number of recipients         (*) |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Recipients  |   R*72 | C(recipient)|C(recipient)... (*) |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Encrypted   |      ~ | The actual encrypted data        |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+

Left out when doing symetric encryption.

Recipient field format:

 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Nonce       |     24 | Random Nonce, one per R          |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Cipher      |     48 | S encrypted with PK or R         |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+

R is calculated using public key encryption using the senders
secret key, the recipients public key and a random nonce.

Pseudocode:

 R = foreach P: N | crypto_box(S, N, P, SK)
 L = len(R)
 T = 5
 write (T | L | R)
 foreach I: write (N | crypto_secret_box(I, N, S))

where P is the public key of a recipient, SK is the senders
secret key, R is the recipient list, L is the number of recipients,
T is the filetype header, I is a block of input with a size
of 32k, N is a nonce (new per block) and S the symmetric key.

The encrypted output maybe Z85 encoded. In this case the Z85
encoding will be done blockwise with blocks of 16k bytes. The
decoded content inside will be as described above.

=head2 SIGNATURE FORMAT

There are different signature formats. Standard binary NACL
signatures have the following format:

 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Content     |      ~ | Original file content            |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | \nnacl-     |      6 | Offset separator                 |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Hash        |     64 | BLAKE2 hash of the content       |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Signature   |     64 | ED25519 signature of BLAKE2 Hash |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+

The actual signature is not a signature over the whole content
of an input file but of a BLAKE2 hash of the content.

Pseudo code:

 H = crypto_generichash(C)
 C | O | H | crypto_sign(H, S)

where C is the message (content), H is the blake2 hash,
O is the offset separator and S is the secret signing key
of the sender.

Armored signatures have the following format:

 ----- BEGIN ED25519 SIGNED MESSAGE -----
 Hash: Blake2
 
 MESSAGE
 
 ----- BEGIN ED25519 SIGNATURE -----
  Version: PCP v0.2.0
 
 195j%-^/G[cVo4dSk7hU@D>NT-1rBJ]VbJ678H4I!%@-)bzi>zOba5$KSgz7b@R]A0!kL$m
 MTQ-1DW(e1mma(<jH=QGA(VudgAMXaKF5AGo65Zx7-5fuMZt&:6IL:n2N{KMto*KQ$:J+]d
 dp1{3}Ju*M&+Vk7=:a=J0}B
 ------ END ED25519 SIGNATURE ------

The Z85 encoded signature at the end contains the same signature
contents as the binary signature outlined above (hash+sig).

=head2 SIGNED ENCRYPTION FORMAT

Signed encrypted files are in binary form only. The first part is
the standard encrypted file as described in B<ENCRYPTED OUTPUT FORMAT>
followed by the binary encrypted signature described in B<SIGNATURE FORMAT>
without the offset separator.

However, not only the hash of the file content will be signed but the
recipient list described in B<ENCRYPTED OUTPUT FORMAT> as well. A
valid recipient is therefore not able to re-encrypt the decrypted
message, append the original signature and send it to other recipients.
The signature would not match since the recipient list differs and
so recipients know that the signature is forged.

Formal file description of sign+encrypt format:

 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Type        |      1 | Filetype, 5=ASYM, 23=SYM         |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Len R       |      4 | Number of recipients         (*) |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Recipients  |   R*72 | C(recipient)|C(recipient)... (*) |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Encrypted   |      ~ | The actual encrypted data        |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Signature   |      ~ | Encrypted signature(*)           |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+

As usual the encrypted signature consists of a nonce and the
actual cipher, which is computed symmetrically (see above)
from the following clear signature.

Before encryption the signature format is:

 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | Field         Size      Description                     |
 +-------------+--------+----------------------------------+
 | Hash        |     64 | BLAKE2 hash of content+R (*)     |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+
 | Signature   |     64 | ED25519 signature of BLAKE2 Hash |
 +-------------|--------|----------------------------------+

where R is: C(recipient)|C(recipient)... (see B<ENCRYPTED OUTPUT FORMAT>).

Pseudocode:

 N | crypto_secret_box( crypto_sign( crypto_generichash( M + R, SK ) ), N, S)

where N is the nonce, M the message, R the recipient list, SK is the senders
secret signing key and S the symmetric key.

=head2 Z85 ENCODING

B<pcp1> uses Z85 to encode binary data (if requested with -z) such
as encrypted data, exported keys or armored signatures.

Encoded data are always enclosed by a header and a footer and may have any number
of comments. Example:

 ----- PCP ENCRYPTED FILE -----
 Version: PCP 0.2.1
 246ge]+yn={<I&&Z%(pm[09lc5[dx4TZALi/6cjVe)Kx5S}7>}]Xi3*N3Xx34Y^0rz:r.5j
 v#6Sh/m3XKwy?VlA+h8ks]9:kVj{D[fd7]NA]T-(ne+xo!W5X5-gIUWqM
 ----- END PCP ENCRYPTED FILE -----

However, the parser tries to be as tolerant as possible. It also accepts
Z85 encoded data without headers or without newlines, empty lines or lines
containing a space are ignored as are comments. Empty comments are not
allowed.

=head3 Z85 BACKGROUND

The Z85 encoding format is described here: B<http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32>.
It's part of ZeroMQ (B<http://zeromq.org>). Z85 is based on ASCII85 with
a couple of modifications (portability, readability etc).

To fulfil the requirements of the ZeroMQ Z85 functions, B<pcp1>
does some additional preparations of raw input before actually doing the 
encoding, since the input for zmq_z85_encode() must be divisible by 4. Therefore
we pad the input with zeroes and remove them after decoding.

B<Trying to use another tool to decode an Z85 encoded string produced
by z85, might not work therefore, unless the tool takes the padding scheme
outlined above into account>.

Z85 encoding and decoding can be used separately as well to work with
files. Examples:

Encode some file to Z85 encoding:

pcp1 -z -I file -O file.z85

Reverse the process:

pcp1 -Z -I file.z85 -O file

=head2 PBP COMPATIBILITY

PCP tries to be fully compatible with PBP (https://github.com/stef/pbp). Encrypted
files and signatures - at least their binary versions - should be exchangable. However,
this is a work in progress and might not work under all circumstances. Also there's currently
no shared key format between pbp and pcp. However, it is possible to export and
import pbp keys from/to pcp.
