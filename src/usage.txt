Usage: pcp1 [options]

General Options:
-V --vault <vaultfile>    Specify an alternate vault file.
                          The deault vault is ~/.pcpvault.
-O --outfile <file>       Output file. If not specified, stdout
                          will be used.
-I --infile <file>        Input file. If not specified, stdin
                          will be used.
-i --keyid <id>           Specify a key id to import/export.
-r --recipient <string>   Specify a recpipient, used for public
                          key export and encryption.
-t --text                 Print textual representation of some
                          item. Either -V or -i must be specified
                          as well.
-h --help                 Print this help message.
-v --version              Print program version.
-D --debug                Enable debug output.

Keymanagement Options:
-k --keygen               Generate a CURVE25519 secret key. If
                          the generated key is the first one in
                          your vault, it will become the primary
                          secret key.
-l --listkeys             List all keys currently stored in your
                          vault. Only the key id's and some info
                          about the keys will be printed, not the
                          actual keys.
-R --remove-key           Remove a key from the vault. Requires
                          option -i <keyid>.
-s --export-secret        Export a secret key. If your vault only
                          contains one secret key, this one will
                          be exported. If a key id have been
                          specified (-i), this one will be used.
                          If there are more than one secret keys
                          in the vault and no key id has been
                          given, export the primary secret key.
                          Use -O to export to a file.
-p --export-public        Export a public key. If no key id have
                          been specified, the public part of your
                          primary secret key will be exported.
                          Use -O to export to a file.
-S --import-secret        Import a secret key. Use -I to import
                          from a file.
-P --import-public        Import a public key. Use -I to import
                          from a file.
-y --export-yaml          Export all keys stored in your vault
                          as YAML formatted text. Use -O to put
                          the export into a file.
Encryption Options:
-e --encrypt              Encrypt a message. Read from stdin or
                          specified via -I. If a keyid (-i) has been
                          given, use that public key for encryption.
                          If a recipient (-r) has been given, use
                          a derived public key. If none of -i or
                          -r has been given, use the primary
                          secret key and the public part of it
                          for encrytion (self-encryption mode).
-d --decrypt              Decrypt a message. Read from stdin or
                          specified via -I. Output to stdout or
                          written to the file specified via -O.
                          The primary secret key will be used for
                          decryption, if there is no primary and
                          just one secret key in the vault, this
                          one will be used. Otherwise you'll have
                          to specify the keyid (-i) of the key.

Signature Options:
-g --sign                 Create a signature of file specified with
                          -I (or from stdin) using your primary
                          secret key. If -r has been given, a derived
                          secret key will be used for signing.

-c --check-signature <file> Verify a signature in file <file> against
                          the file specified with -I (or stdin).
                          The public key required for this must
                          exist in your vault file.

Encoding Options:
-z --z85-encode           Encode something to Z85 encoding. Use
                          -I and -O respectively, otherwise it
                          stdin/stdout.
-Z --z85-decode           Decode something from Z85 encoding. Use
                          -I and -O respectively, otherwise it
                          stdin/stdout
