This   is   a   raw   version  of   Config::General,   available   via
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-General/. It's  not part of  PCP in
any way. I  just distribute it with PCP so  that running the unittests
is possible without installing this modulee.

So, this is  not the latest version,  it is not supported  (as part of
PCP), do not open an issue about  it on github. Issues for this module
go to http://rt.cpan.org/.

Thanks.

PS: as I am the author of  this perl module, I hereby grant permission
to myself to redistribute it with PCP.
